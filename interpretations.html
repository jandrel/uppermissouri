                        <p><h2>Introduction</h2>
In 1801, a Siksiká Blackfeet chief named Ackomokki partnered with a Hudson's Bay Company trader named Peter Fidler to draw and label <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/00556405/">a map of the upper Missouri River region</a> (present-day Montana).  One trading post is noted on the map, Chesterfield House, and marked an important feat for Ackomokki who negotiated the post's establishment with Fidler in the previous months. Blackfoot namesakes and their English translations specify mountain peaks, hills, and watersheds.

When Ackomokki shared his geographic knowledge with Fidler, it was evident to both parties that this was Blackfoot space.  In the late 18th century, explorers and fur traders who entered these lands with business prospects knew the importance of learning Native languages, cultural customs, and understanding the power of kinship to facilitate trade. Over the next fifty years, the map passed through hands until its final resting place in the HBC archive in London. To prospective fur companies like the HBC, the significance of Ackomokki’s geographic knowledge can be summed best by the final notation accompanying the map: “His knowledge of the Missouri sources was greater than the information of our geographers at that time.”

However, more than a geographic snapshot of the upper Missouri, Ackomak-Ki’s map details Blackfoot ways of endowing land with special meaning rooted in local knowledge, myth, and history. In this sketch, the continental divide of the Rocky Mountains cuts through the center of the page, known in the Blackfoot language as <em>Miistakis</em> or “backbone.” Consistent with many Indigenous cultures, Blackfoot geography is constructed based on an inseparable understanding of space and time. Land is fundamental to human experiences and interactions, what anthropologist Keith Basso explains as “that close companion of heart and mind” which connects landscape to identity.[1]

<em>Mapping the Upper Missouri </em>began as an inquiry into the map created by Ackomokki and Peter Fidler. Their collaboration hints to a much larger and complex history of the upper Missouri's stakes in the global fur trade, the history of intertribal relations, the early history of capitalism in North America, and the amorphous state of diplomacy from exchange to territoriality.  Ultimately, two key arguments arise out of this project. First, that over the course of the first half of the nineteenth century, the fur trade transitioned from sites of exchange into sites of administration and surveillance. Secondly, the upper Missouri Indigenous communities affected by these transitions strategically responded in ways to ensure their survival and persistence.
<h2>Storymapping &amp; Georectification</h2>
Richard White's  frequently cited article, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29">"What is Spatial History?"</a> continues to inspire and challenge the way that historians think about the relationship between space and time in their work. Whereas traditional historical methods emphasize the centrality of time to narrative, White reverses this notion to argue that space is just as important. <em>Mapping the Upper Missouri </em>builds upon these foundations to reconceptualize the cultrual, political, and economic construction of space in the American West.

This project uses two digital methods: <strong>Storymapping </strong>and <strong>Georectification </strong>to ground this rich and complex narrative within geography. Visually, it exemplifies diverse and evolving perceptions of the land over time; a theme that cannot be easily captured or conveyed in traditional historical research and writing. Storymapping is the process of building an interactive geographic narrative or historical tour of key locations (marked by pins or polygons) that enable the audience to traverse both space and time. <em>Mapping the Upper Missouri </em>also uses the practice of Georectification, which is the method of overlaying a human-produced map onto a web-mapping service (like Mapbox, OpenStreetMap, or Google Maps). Georectifying historical maps, like Ackomokki's and Fidler's 1801 map, can powerfully reorient the viewer's perspective and recast the space in a historical framework. Together, these methods illustrate that time is not always linear and that geography can challenge neat, chronological histories.

<em>Mapping the Upper Missouri</em> begins by placing viewers in the context of the Louisiana Purchase (1803), but emphasizes that when Lewis and Clark's party reached the Three Forks region in southwestern Montana, they encountered long-established Indigenous communities and a thriving micro-political economy produced by the fur trade. Subsequent points discuss a variety locations, events, and people who played a part in conceptualizing the upper Missouri. This project relies upon sources of visual culture: maps, art, and prints which are immersive and encourage viewers to consider new analyses of "atypical" historical sources (i.e. traditional text documents). In doing so, the storymap builds an <em>experience </em>that can be both educational and pedagogical.
