Defining the Upper Missouri River Region,media/lewisclark1805.jpg,"Edgar S. Paxson, ""Lewis and Clark at Three Forks,"" oil on canvas, 1912, Montana.gov.",https://mhs.mt.gov/education/Capitol/Art/House-Lobby,"The United States' acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 marked a new era of westward expansion, commencing with the famous 8,000 mile trek of American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark under the guidance of Sacagewea (Akaitikka/Lemhi Shoshone). When the group arrived at the Three Forks region (southwestern Montana) in July of 1805, they encountered a long-established presence Indigenous communities, trappers, and traders. Since the late eighteenth century, the British Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), expanded into the southernmost parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, attracting the business partnerships of several Indigenous communities including the Hóhe (Assiniboine), Niitsítapi (Blackfoot Confederacy), Tsétsêhéstâhese and Só'taeo'o (Cheyenne), Nêhiyaw (Cree), Apsáalooke (Crow), Dakȟóta (Dakota), A'aninin (Gros Ventre), Ktunaxa (Kootenai), Lakȟóta (Lakota), Ql̓ispé (Kalispel/ Pend d'Oreilles), and Séliš (Salish). This northern portion of the great plains and intermountain West, the upper Missouri River region, became one of the most important and final epicenters of the global fur trade. Of all the items that passed between Indigenous and Euro-American traders, however, the exchange of knowledge was the most valuable and fulfilled an important goal of the trade: to expand business and by extension, spheres of influence.",4.3,,45.8839286,-111.5926214,Louisiana Purchase,,,http://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/46923/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.7
Chesterfield House,media/chesterfieldhouse.jpg,"Ackomokki and Peter Fidler, Indian Map of the Upper Missouri, 1801, Library of Congress.",https://www.loc.gov/item/00556405/,"Fur companies needed intricate knowledge of Indigenous languages, cultural customs, and kinship traditions to facilitate effective trade. As a result, Indigenous communities often determined the limits and conduct of exchange. In the summer of 1801, a Siksiká Blackfoot chief named Ackomokki negotiated with the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) for the establishment of Chesterfield House in Blackfoot territory. Represented in the map as a humble trading post at the fork of the Red Deer and Saskatchewan Rivers, Chesterfield House was an important feat for the Blackfeet who wanted to enter the trade and maintain peace between their Nêhiyaw (Cree) and Hóhe (Assiniboine) neighbors. This historic map was a product of the collaboration between Ackomokki and HBC trader, Peter Fidler, who worked closely with the Blackfeet for the establishment of Chesterfield House while also garnering detailed geographic information about the Missouri River and its tributaries.",6.5,,48.6572947,-111.1065775,,,,http://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/43844/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.7

For decades, the Great Lakes reinforced the concept of the “Middle Ground” where European (predominantly French) and Indigenous communities engaged in mutually-beneficial trade. With the addition of the Louisiana Purchase, U.S. fur companies like the American Fur Company closed in on the potential of the upper Missouri to compete with Hudson’s Bay and simultaneously oust the British presence in U.S. territory. Although there had always been a colonial underpinning of the fur trade, these new pressures worsened rivalries, environmental threats, and violence. The trade was inseparable from nationalistic aspirations and objectives.",5.5,,42.3526257,-83.2392911,"Detroit, Michigan",,,http://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/47073/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.8

Rolling foothills and lush riverbanks encase the quiet prairies surrounding Fort Union, placed at the heart of the canvas. To Catlin’s eye, the lines of exchange are clear: the presence of the trading post reshaped both the modes of negotiation and brought new order to the area’s Indigenous communities, represented by the numerous tipis surrounding the fort. Atop a hilly foreground, an interaction takes place between a Native American individual and a fur trader.

However, instead of emphasizing the stationary appearance of tipis and the subdued nature of the landscape, Bodmer accentuates movement to and from the fort. When compared to the humble representation of Chesterfield House in Ackomokki and Peter Fidler’s map (panel two), Catlin and Bodmer illustrated the transformative qualities they believed to be embodied by Fort Union. Far from becoming the new center of local Indigenous communities, Fort Union and subsequent AFC posts throughout the region adapted successfully to the Indigenous socio-economic norms which dictated the pathways of exchange.",9,Fort Union,47.9892426,-104.0386227,,Match,Google,,

The gradual growth of these posts began to shift objectives away from the trade and towards the surveillance and ownership of the land. The semi-sedentary nature of both trading posts and their business with partnered Indigenous communities provided a structure to expand U.S. administrative control.

",https://www.nps.gov/fous/learn/historyculture/culbertson-mourning-brooch.htm,"Whereas the HBC discouraged marriage between Indigenous women and girls, nearly all traders in the AFC had Native wives and developed close bonds to her family and community. Likewise, as Indigenous communities sought to sustain their involvement in the trade, intermarriage often enabled women to augment their own authority by becoming cultural brokers and business intermediaries. Such was the case for AFC trader Alexander Culbertson who married fifteen-year-old Natoyist-Siksina’, the daughter of a prominent Kainah (Blood) Blackfeet headman named Two Suns. Although their marriage produced clear benefits for Culbertson, Natoyist-Siksina’ held the status as one of the most important diplomats in the upper Missouri. Natoyist-Sikisina’ was in the heart of both the turmoil affecting Native communities like her own as well as the effort to navigate U.S. colonial policy on the northern plains. In 1846, the couple negotiated the establishment of Fort Benton in Blackfoot Territory and marked the pinnacle of personal success for Culbertson, who thereafter turned his attention towards efforts to organize the upper Missouri through a series of land policies.",9,Fort Benton,47.8267696,-110.6488537,,,,,

Fifty-two years after Ackomokki and Peter Fidler’s map, an anonymous Hóhe (Assiniboine) warrior sketched his view of the Missouri River from Fort Union to Fort Benton. Annotated by the famous trader Edwin Denig, this map shares a striking resemblance to the 1801 rendition and centers the Missouri River, its tributaries, and significant geographic features. A few labeled “trade houses” appear as small boxes in the large swath of space, which also includes the Assiniboine “war path” dashed to Blackfoot Territory. This map does not acknowledge the new colonial boundaries imposed upon the upper Missouri, but rather reinforces an Indigenous vew of the space as it has always been. Despite the efforts of colonial powers to reimagine, redraw, and visualize the space as their own, nation building requires recognition—something that Indigenous peoples continue to resist and challenge today.",7,,47.6205706,-108.6584197,Mid-Missouri Montana,,,http://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/45839/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.7
